# Huffman-Encoding
It is a Lossless Compression Algorithm, i.e no data is lost in this compression, that works on replacing the most frequently occurring characters with smaller codes generated by the Huffman Tree and replacing them with the prefix code.

The decoding is done using the same tree.

Time Complexity is O(N log N) because we are extracting minimum nodes 2*(n-1) times and each time whenever a node is being extracted from the heap then a function called heapify() is being called to rearrange the element according to their priority.This function heapify() takes O(log N) time.

Space Complexity: O(N)
